fourier-space inverse of the KS kernel seems to work, while the fourier-space 
inverse of the signal covariance (S_DD) does not.  I think this is because
the magnitude of the KS kernel approaches 1 for large k, so that its inverse
is well-behaved.  On the other hand, the magnitude of S_DD approaches 0 for
large k, so the inverse is not well-behaved, and numerical accuracy issues
are substantially amplified.

So, for the regularization of the wiener-filtered matrix, I plan to use
the fourier-space inverse of P_kd, and the numerical inverse of S_DD.

LU factorization [ scipy.linalg.lu_factor(X) ] will be faster, if N>=32

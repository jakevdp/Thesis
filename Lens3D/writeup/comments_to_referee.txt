We thank the referee for helpful comments in improving the study presented
in this paper.  Below are our responses to the referee's comments and concerns:
On top of addressing these concerns, we have added an appendix detailing the
formalism of our SVD method.  The rest of the text is largely unchanged.

1) Abstract: "We find however that linear... reconstructions have a fundamental limitation" - you've ably illustrated that this may be the case by this work, but I'm not sure you've proven it formally? If I'm right, it would be useful to soften this statement.

We addressed this concern by adding a new section (3.4) which discusses the noise properties of line-of-sight modes.  We believe this new discussion supports this assertion of a "fundamental limitation" in the redshift direction.

2) It would be helpful to flesh out section 3.4 - I felt that this was dealt with rather too briefly. Could you:

[note: this is now section 3.5]

(a) add discussion of whether your field is typical, i.e. whether one should expect this number of halos of this mass in this size of field, or is it purely illustrative; 

we added this discussion in section 3.5

(b) include an e.g. theta_x z plot to show how well/not well the reconstructions do in the z direction, and add discussion of this; 

we added these plots in the right column of figure 6, 
and a brief discussion of these plots in section 3.5

(c) include some information in a table or figure to discuss how well the masses are recovered in each case?

this information is now included in table 1.  We added discussion at the 
end of section 3.4 about the difficulty in determining halo masses
using nonparametric methods.

\chapter{Conclusion}

Here we conclude.

Summarize the strengths of KL analysis, and the power of weak lensing
analysis to answer substantive cosmological questions.  Here we've shown
how KL addresses three separate areas of weak lensing study:
3D mass mapping (noise filtration), Shear peak statistics (interpolation),
Parameter estimation (noise filtration / compact representation).

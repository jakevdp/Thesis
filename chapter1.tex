\chapter{Introduction to Cosmology}

Here we have the introduction of the field of cosmology.

\begin{itemize}
\item Start with a bit of history (The view of the universe in the early 20th
century, how Einstein's GR,   Hubble's redshifts, and Lemaitre's idea of
the big bang).

\item FLRW metric

\item Observations: looking for standard rulers and/or standard candles.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cepheids, MS fitting, Tully-Fisher relationship, supernovae
    \item WMAP anisotropies, BAO, formation of structure, etc.
  \end{itemize}

\item Correlation functions and power spectra; peak counts

\item Weak lensing constraints on cosmology

  \begin{itemize}
    \item theory \& math behind the weak lensing approximation
    \item weak lensing power spectra constraints on cosmology
    \item weak lensing peak counts \& constraints on cosmology
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Mention work with the supernova collaboration \citep{Kessler2009}.
We also should briefly mention here \cite{Jain2011} and alternatives
to standard cosmological models \citep[also][]{Sollerman2009}.

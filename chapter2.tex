\chapter{Introduction to KL Analysis}

Here we do an introduction to KL.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduce the notational formalism
  \item KL as an eigenvalue problem
  \item KL as a signal-to-noise ranking
  \item KL as an optimal low-dimensional representation
  \item KL on noisy data
  \item KL with missing information
\end{itemize}

Also mention LLE and cite \cite{Vanderplas2009}, which uses a nonlinear
alternative to PCA for dimensionalty reduction.
